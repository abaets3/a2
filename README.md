TLDR; run python RO.py and python NN.py after all packages installed and you make a plots dir.

To run this code you will need to install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib mlrose--hive

You can use pip or conda or whatever you would like. I just did pip.

I have included the data in the data dir, so no need to download it

Then make a plots directory in the root, very important!

Once you have the correct packages installed and the plots dir, just run python RO.py and python NN.py. This will generate ALL the charts and data used in my project write up. It will take a while to complete (60minutes+) If you just want to execute a small portion of RO, you can comment out the method calls at the very bottom of RO.py. NN is just one huge thing, so you can't comment anything out there.

a few notes: -Nothing says the class name on the github so that it doesn't come up in search results -I am planning to delete the repository after the semester ends -Make sure you have a plots dir -I did this on the linux subsystem on windows (WSL2) -Should in theory work on any linux machine (I did not extensively test this) -There is some mild seeding but not super robust, therefore not all charts produced will match 100% to the project report 

TLDR; run python RO.py and python NN.py after all packages installed you make a plots dir.
